# Autonomous Driving 



##  For the task purpose please check these two python codes

I copied the two most important files to the root of the repo for you to check them easily: <br/><br/>
- main_with_traffic_detection_and_turn_with_recording_try_sim_time_with_map_client.py
- map_server.py
<br/>

but if you want to see them in the project, please check these paths:

```bash

# this is the path of the main file, which will run the car fully autonomous and it will run a client thread 
# connected to the map server
BFMC_Simulator/startup_workspace/src/startup_package/src/main_with_traffic_detection_and_turn_with_recording_try_sim_time_with_map_client.py


# this isn the path for the TCP map server which will run a GUI interface to the map and will receive the car 
# location and destination and update the GUI interactively while the car moving and it will calculate the 
# shortest route using dijkstra
BFMC_Simulator/startup_workspace/osmnx/MAPserver/map_server.py


```
